abstract="Garbage collectors are very hard to implement correctly due to their low-level manipulation of memory. In this paper, we construct a copying garbage collector which we have proved to be functionally correct. Our verification proof is structured as a sequence of refinements to aid clarity and proof reuse; it is the first to map implementations into three different machine languages and, unlike some noteworthy published proofs, our verified implementations of memory allocation handle termination and the `out-of-memory' case properly. The work presented here has been developed in the HOL4 theorem prover.",

abstract="The Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver Z3 can generate proofs of unsatisfiability. We present independent reconstruction of unsatisfiability proofs for bit-vector theories in the theorem provers HOL4 and Isabelle/HOL. Our work shows that LCF-style proof reconstruction for the theory of fixed-size bit-vectors, although difficult because Z3's proofs provide limited detail, is often possible. We thereby obtain high correctness assurances for Z3's results, and increase the degree of proof automation for bit-vector problems in HOL4 and Isabelle/HOL.",

	abstract="We present here an axiomatic approach which enables one to prove by formal methods that his program is ``totally correct'' (i.e., it terminates and is logically correct---does what it is supposed to do). The approach is similar to Hoare's approach [3] for proving that a program is ``partially correct'' (i.e., that whenever it terminates it produces correct results). Our extension to Hoare's method lies in the possibility of proving both correctness and termination by one unified formalism. One can choose to prove total correctness by a single step, or by incremental proof steps, each step establishing more properties of the program.",
